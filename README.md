# google-sheet-node

## Description

An application is built with:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/) is a free, open-sourced, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser.
- [googleapis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/googleapis) The full list of supported APIs can be found on the Google APIs Explorer. The API endpoints are automatically generated, so if the API is not in the list, it is currently not supported by this API client library.
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
- [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database.
